/* You must implement the following breakpoints that will be considered 
desktop, tablet, and mobile. The browser should display a desktop version 
of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px and above. Tablet 
view should appear only if the width of the browser window is 
between 768px and 991px, inclusively. Mobile view should appear only if 
the width of the browser is equal to or less than 767px. */

/* Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should 
take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window 
wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. 
(Hint: use percentages to define width and use the 'float' property. See Lecture 24). 
For a visual reference of this view, see the desktop mockup illustration below. */

/* Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the 
first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section 
should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. For a visual 
reference of this view, see the tablet mockup illustration below. */

/* Layout: In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), 
each section should take up the entire row. For a visual reference of this view,
 see the mobile mockup illustration below. */

/* Section title region: Each section should have a section title region that is 
 always positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the view 
 (desktop, tablet or mobile). Copy the titles from the mockup illustration 
 (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own. (Hint: use relative and 
 absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22.) */

/* Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. 
 Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal and vertical). Note the 
 horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of the 
 browser window. Also, note the spacing between the dummy text in each section 
 and the edges of the section. Lastly, make sure the dummy text is 
 "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region. 
 (Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as 
 discussed in Lecture 19.) */

/* Borders and Colors: Each section should have a background color set to 
 some color (of your choosing). Set the background color of each section 
 title region to some unique color (of your choosing). Make sure that the 
 background color still allows the user to view the text in the section and 
 section title regions. Depending on the color you choose, you may want to 
 change the color of the text so it can be easy to read. Set a black border 
 on both the section and section title region that is 1px thick. 
 Warning: While not specifying borders and colors according to the 
 requirements does not hurt your grade so much, not doing so will make it 
 much harder for your classmates to peer grade the rest of your assignment, 
 possibly resulting in a much lower grade. */

/* (OPTIONAL) You will NOT be graded on this, but you may want to 
explicitly set a font-family for the text in your page, so you are not 
stuck with the default browser font family. Also, set the font size of 
the heading and section title to be 75% larger and 25% larger (respectively) 
than the font size of the dummy text. */
